"""A module for creating swapfiles.

A swapfile is a yaml file that contains all possible combinations of swaps that
can be made in a template. This modules provides the functionality to create
these files instead of generate them manually.

To use this functionatility, pass a swapfile and swaps to dir-wand but no
template.

Example:
    dir-wand --swapfile path/to/swapfile.yaml --swap1 1 2 3 --swap2 4 5 6
